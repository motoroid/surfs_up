# Surfs Up! Analysis

## Purpose
### The purpose of this project is to provide W. Avy more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
####  1.   The average temperature is pretty similar at 74 and 71 degrees with only a 3 degree standard deviation.
####  2.   The highs are within a degree of each other and are 85 and 82 degrees.
####  3.   The only real difference is that the low in december is 56 degrees whereas June is 64.      


## Summary
#### The summary statistics for the temps in June and December are below.

It appears that the average temperature is pretty similar and the lows in december don't seem enough not to continue with the shop.  In general the mean and other numbers are pretty similar only a few degrees off of each other.  
### Two optional queries are
#### 1.  Since June and Decenber are the start of summer and winter there is an option to do march and september to capture spring and fall.  

#### 2.  Another option is to capture a couple months within the rainy season of Hawaii between November to March.
